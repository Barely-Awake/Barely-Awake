### woah, you found my github profile!!!
(i'm ryan btw)

i'm currently working on [Observer](https://discord.gg/fYUSmYWbCZ), a Hypixel statistics tracking bot

i mainly use TypeScript, but i know Go, Python, and Lua (and js but that's kinda obvious)

also i mainly use Discord so if you want to reach out to me that's probably the best way. you can reach me @ [Barely Awake#1813](https://discord.com/users/772890071681466379) though it may be best to join [this server](https://discord.gg/fYUSmYWbCZ) and @ me, i might not accept your friend request
