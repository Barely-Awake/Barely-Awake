### woah, you found my github profile!!!
(i'm ryan btw)

[Observer](https://discord.gg/fYUSmYWbCZ) is my main project right now, it's a Hypixel statistics tracking bot.

TypeScript is what I usually use, but i know Go, Python, and Lua (and js ofc)

you can reach me @ [barelyawake](https://discord.com/users/772890071681466379) on discord though it may be best to join [this server](https://discord.gg/fYUSmYWbCZ) and @ me, since i might not accept your friend request
